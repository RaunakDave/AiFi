TechOps Challenge 1: Kubernetes initContainer 
    Create a Kubernetes Pod manifest with the following requirements: 
    An initContainer that retrieves the number of CPU cores and memory available in the system and saves them for further usage. 
    A container that uses the previous variables and logs them in the stdout of the pod. 

TechOps Challenge 2: Build a simple API that interfaces with relational database. 
    Schema: 
        Customer: 
            ID 
            FirstName 
            LastName 
            Age 
            Email 
            StoreID (Foreign Key) 
            Cases (Foreign Key) 
        
        Store: 
            ID 
            Name 
            Address 
            Customers (Foreign Key) 
            Cases (Foreign Key) 

        Case: 
            ID 
            StartTimestamp 
            EndTimestamp 
            CustomerID (Foreign Key) 
            StoreID (Foreign Key) 

    Endpoints: 
        CRUD for Customer 
        CRUD for Store 
        CRUD for Cases  

Upload code to Github repository and README.md with instructions on how to run it. 
Provide a performance test for 1000 GET queries on customers, stores, and cases.
